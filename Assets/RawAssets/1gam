1GAM IDEAS:
Kawaii factor: player character emotion is displayed to the player via emoji/japanese emoticons

You are an employee of a maid cafe, you have a number of tables you are in charge of

they will have wants and emotions

you get a request from the ticker on top of the screen

if you don't fufil that request in time their feeling will drop a level

things to do/minigames:

Karaoke:
bring machine to table
singing minigame
type notes/type words

Conversation:
just go to table
select correct responses to questions
YOU WILL BE ASKED ABOUT THE ANSWERS LATER
(favourite colour)

Kittens:
Bring a kitten to the table
stop the kitten from leaving the table

Cake:
bring a cake
cut the cake

Tea:
bring tea
pour tea

Bill:
bring bill
tick boxes of what they had?



Genre : Strategy

I also love the idea of playing a character who is PRETENDING to be blind, so you have to keep bumping into things to not arouse suspicion
